# Daedalus

I developed this package by putting together pieces of code that I use for running and analyzing mostly psychophysics experiments.

## Usage

To use, clone or download the repository, navigate to the directory and install the package by running:

```shell
     pip install -e .
```

Import subpackages based on usage needs:

```python
    >>> from daedalus.vision import psychphys
    >>> from daedalus.fmri import multivariate
```
